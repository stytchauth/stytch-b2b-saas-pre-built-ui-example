# This database is for demo purposes only!

The Stytch part of this app does not depend on this database at all. **Once you've dropped the example SaaS logic from the app (adding and deleting ideas), you can safely delete this entire `db` folder and the `drizzle.config.ts` at the server root.**

This is only here so it's possible to run the demo locally without needing to provision or initialize a database.
